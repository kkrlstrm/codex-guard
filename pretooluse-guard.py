"""PreToolUse guard for the Codex CLI session (fail-OPEN).

Wire this into ~/.codex/hooks.json for the tools you want guarded (Bash,
apply_patch, and any MCP surface). It loads a ruleset and lets the shared engine
decide: rules that would fail anyway become non-blocking nudges (injected as
additionalContext so the model self-corrects); a couple of destructive patterns
block (exit 2) or deny.

Install it with:  python3 install.py            (writes ~/.codex/hooks.json, backed up)

Ruleset resolution:
  $CODEX_GUARD_RULES  -> use that file (point it at your own tuned ruleset)
  else                -> rules/starter.rules.json next to this script

All logic lives in guard/ (engine, runner, audit); rules live in JSON. Safety
bias: any error -> exit 0 (allow). See README.md and docs/WHEN_TO_USE.md.
